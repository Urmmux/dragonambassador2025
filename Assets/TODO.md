low-priority or optional ideas:
randomize territory colors inside dragstats/dragstatinitial
different visual for territory vs territory edge
add more biomes -boneshard plains and precambrian shelf?

mid-priority:
the boat issue, how do boats get used up?
    -use three times?
    -notify player when breaking
item use during PlayerMove
player can capture monsters from caves/ruins as a pet, has one pet slot that fights alongside them
if item use during player move, player makes secret bases
pet in secret base
add mimics
battle animations, requires art first

high-priority:

PlayerFight()
    -spells should actually do things
    -NPC targets should be smarter
    -status effect cooldowns
    -battle end

Monster sprites
NegotiateWithAttacker()
set cooldowns to zero when leaving a location
now that TextLibrary is up, issue dragon-personal opening when first entering location 
economy manager runs during NPC resolve phase. Dragons get more abilities at certain wealth thresholds.
cities need to track history like dragons do

start on heroes
-transition to location interact upon collision with a hero sprite
-once heroes spawn can make dragon decisions not always attack

title screen
pause screen
save/load

treasure
    -dragons successfully killing other dragons need to take some, but not all, of the treasure

boredom
    -after implementing boredom increases, make sure to drop to zero after the dragon takes an action
